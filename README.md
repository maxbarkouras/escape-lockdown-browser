# Escape LockDown Browser
LockDown Browser injection to escape "locked" state and remove keyboard/mouse hooks, allowing for normal and undetected computer use. 

This was entirley developed for my own learning and deep dive into unhooking, EDR evasion, and assembly on windows.


***i do not condone using this during an assingment or exam on lockdown browser***
